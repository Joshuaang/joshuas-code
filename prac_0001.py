Exercise 1: Understanding Function Parameters and Arguments
Objective: Demonstrate that the values of a and b are passed 
to x and y respectively. Understand that 
the original values of a and b are passed as arguments to the 
            function parameters x and y.

# def multiply(num1, num2):
#             return num1 * num2
# print(multiply(5, 4))

Exercise 2: Local vs. Global Scope
Objective: Show the difference between a local variable x inside the 
            function and the global variable x outside. 
            Understand the concept of scope.
'''
y = 10



'''
Exercise 3: Using the global Keyword
Objective: Illustrate how the global keyword allows a function to modify a 
            global variable. Students should see that the change inside the 
            function affects the global variable.
'''


'''
Exercise 4: Shadowing Global Variables
            Learn how local variables can shadow global variables within 
            the function's scope, without affecting the global variable.

Exercise 5: Function with Default Parameters
            Objective: This exercise demonstrates how default parameters work 
            when no argument is passed. It will help students understand the 
            flexibility of function calls in Python.

Exercise 6: Accessing Global Variables within a Function
            Demonstrate how a function can access a global variable when 
            it's not defined within the function itself. 
            In this example, the global variable x is used inside the 
            function add. The function adds the value of x (which is 10) 
            to the argument a (which is 5), resulting in an output of 15.
